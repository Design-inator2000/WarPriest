War Priest V2.0 Patch Notes

Fixes:
-Player was able to "climb the wall" due to breaks in wall collision box
-Player could only enter second part of first hallway in one spot; can now simply walk to edge of screen to initiate transition

New features:
-Player can speak to the TechPriest in the Guardian room to learn location of items, and track which items they have collected

Improvements:
-Reworked visuals
-Dialogue reworked: npcs will give player vital information on first interaction, and have world building dialogue if interacted with again
-When npcs mention collectable items, an image of the sprite appears in the text box
